# A Submit Tutorial

Provide a step-by-step walkthrough of forking, customizing, running, and
testing.

In particular, it would be great if you could show how to ...

* add a few form fields (e.g., day, month, and year fields for indicating
  date-of-birth)
* validate the new fields as appropriate
* set up the server in your home dir on midway
* have the server write out submissions to a log (e.g., `birthdays.csv`)

## Adding a New Form Field

['Here'](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/submit/blob/master/client/index.html#L40-L45) is the block of code for the form field for first name in index.html. Simply copy and paste within the form tags and modify to create a new form field.
