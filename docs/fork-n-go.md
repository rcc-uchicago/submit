# Fork-n-Go

A [Fork-n-Go](http://jlord.github.io/forkngo/) project is a project on GitHub that in a few clicks and starting with a fork, gives another user a live website that they can quickly customize for their particular needs.

Two awesome things make this possible: **Forking** and [**GitHub Pages**](http://pages.github.com).

On GitHub, a **fork** is a full copy of a repository, on your account, that you
can manage and edit. It's done with the click of a button.

**GitHub Pages** is the hosting service that GitHub provides free to all users,
organizations _and_ repositories. This means everyone of these entities or
project can have it's own website at a predictable domain:

- **organizations**: orgname.github.io
- **users**: username.github.io
- **repositories**: username.github.io/repositoryname

To have a website for a repository all you need is a branch named `gh-pages`.
GitHub will then look in that branch for web files and serve them up at the
address.

For a nice example of a fork-n-go project, see [this blog post](http://jlord.us/fork-n-go/).
